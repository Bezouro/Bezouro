### ‚ö° Hi there üëã

I'm a passionate technology enthusiast with a keen interest in programming and an ongoing drive to learn more about it. When I'm not coding, you can find me playing video games or indulging in my other favorite hobbies - developing software, watching captivating series and discovering new movies.

  - [CloudScript](https://cloudscript.bezouro.com.br/)
    - CloudScript is a platform for developing, managing, and delivering macros for Minecraft. Macros are scripts that automate tasks within the game, allowing the       creation of bots that perform repetitive tasks.

      The platform includes an integrated development environment specifically designed for creating Minecraft macros, as well as a dashboard for monitoring usage      statistics, whitelists for access control, and a chat feature for users.

      CloudScript users are divided into two types: script creators/developers and script users. Script users install the CloudScript mod in Minecraft and can take advantage of hundreds of free and paid scripts that perform a wide variety of functions in the game.

      Script developers create high-performance scripts to automate repetitive tasks in the game, publish their scripts, and control access to their scripts by users.
